<h1>An elegant little scrollout menu with appearing/disappearing buttons</h1>
<h4>Great for resonsive designs</h4>
<p>The globe icon is a single SVG file that is placed inline at both ends of the menu. CSS rotates the first one and changes the fill on hover. The animations are done in jQuery.</p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and <em>ahem</em>, dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
